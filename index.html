Cybersecurity Awareness Message ‚Äì Password Safety
Your password is more than just a key ‚Äî it‚Äôs your digital identity.
In today‚Äôs connected world, the strength of your passwords defines the strength of your online security. Every account you own ‚Äî from social media to banking ‚Äî is protected only as well as the password guarding it. Weak or reused credentials are like leaving your front door open in a storm of cyber threats.
<div>
<span style="color: #f5c84b;font-size: 1.8rem;">The numbers are alarming:</span>
Every year, over 2 billion passwords are leaked or stolen through data breaches, phishing campaigns, and brute-force attacks. Studies show that 81% of hacking-related breaches involve weak or reused passwords, and more than 60% of users admit to using the same password across multiple accounts. Once one account is compromised, attackers can quickly chain into your entire digital life ‚Äî from emails to financial records.
</div>
<div>
<span style="color: #f5c84b;font-size: 1.8rem;">What can you do?</span>
Create strong, unique passwords for every service you use. A strong password should be long (at least 12‚Äì16 characters), unpredictable, and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Never share passwords, and avoid storing them in plain text. For best protection, use a trusted password manager and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible.
</div>
<div>
<span style="color: #f5c84b;font-size: 1.8rem;">Remember:</span>  
Cybersecurity isn‚Äôt just about technology ‚Äî it‚Äôs about responsibility.
Every secure password you create helps make the internet a safer place for everyone, starting with you.
