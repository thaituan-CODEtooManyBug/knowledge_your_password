#Knowledge your password
Hi, My name is Tran Nguyen Thai Tuan
This small project was created with the goal of raising awareness about password security and encouraging people to use stronger, safer passwords in their daily lives. Everything runs entirely in the browser â€” no passwords are stored, logged, or sent anywhere. This project is built for learning, experimentation, and promoting better password hygiene for everyone.
